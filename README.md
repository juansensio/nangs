> Solving Partial Differential Equations with Neural Networks.

Nangs is a Python library built on top of Pytorch to solve Partial Differential Equations.

Our objective is to develop a new tool for simulating nature, using Neural Networks as solution approximation to Partial Differential Equations, increasing accuracy and optimziation speed while reducing computational cost.

Read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04737) to know more.

## Installing

nangs is on PyPI so you can just run:

`pip install nangs`

You will also need to insall [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Getting Started

- Learn how to work with nangs with our [tutorials](https://juansensio.github.io/nangs/master/blob/tutorials)
- See nangs in actions with our [examples](https://juansensio.github.io/nangs/master/blob/examples)
